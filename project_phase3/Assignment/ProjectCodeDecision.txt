We chose to use my (Bryan) code because it was most complete.

We first reviewed Eric's code and the overall code was not tested. Additionally within Sales
Application, restock inventory was not implemented correctly causing issues on the the other
methods that depend on it working.

When we reviewed Harry's code, his SalesApplication had a lot of bugs. His ShoppingCart class was
not finished which is a large part of the customer's usage in SalesApplication. His
EmployeeInterface was also not finished which caused issues in for the rest of the application that
depended on them. Furthermore, he did not follow SOLID design principles well in some of his code.

We then reviewed Tien's code, which was overall not finished andh is SalesApplication was not tested.
Furthermore, his code was not well structured and he did not follow the SOLID principles well.

When we reviewed my code, my code was generally tested for basic functionality. We noticed some edge
cases were not covered, for example, creating a blank password was allowed. Additionally some things
minor things were not implemented such as totalprice not being sanitized in the
DatabaseInsertHelper.insertSale() function. Other than that, the code was well structured except for
in some parts of SalesApplication and followed SOlID generally well. Overall, the application is
able to perform all basic functionality that was required in SalesApplication for base cases and
that was the main reason we chose to use my code as the base for the project.
